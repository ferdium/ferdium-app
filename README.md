> ü§¥üèΩ Hard-fork of [Franz](https://github.com/meetfranz/franz), adding awesome features and removing unwanted ones.

Ferdium is a desktop app that helps you organize how you use your favourite apps by combining them into one application. It is based on Franz - a software already used by thousands of people - with the difference that Ferdium gives you many additional features and doesn't restrict its usage! Furthermore, Ferdium is compatible with your existing Franz account, so you can continue right where you left off. Please find out more about Ferdium and its features on [ferdium.org](https://ferdium.org).

## Unsigned Nightlies on MacOS

Since we are waiting to acquire the Apple Developer License, we are publishing our nightlies without being signed. If you download these, and are on MacOS beyond Catalina, you will face the issue that the OS says the `dmg` is corrupted. If so, please run the command in [this comment](https://github.com/ferdium/ferdium-app/issues/34#issuecomment-1107655575)

## Migrating from Ferdi

If you are a pre-existing user of Ferdi, and are thinking of switching to Ferdium, you might want to run [the following script](./scripts/migration/migrate-windows.ps1) to migrate your existing Ferdi profile such that Ferdium can pick up the configurations.
