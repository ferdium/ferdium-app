2. If you are requesting support for a **new service** in Ferdi, please log it [here](https://github.com/getferdi/recipes/pulls)
3. Please remember to read the [self-help documentation](https://github.com/getferdi/ferdi#troubleshooting-recipes-self-help) - in case it helps you unblock yourself for issues related to older versions of recipes that were installed on your machine.
