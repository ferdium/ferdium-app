   addresses, routers will more generally have knowledge of one or more
   of the hierarchical boundaries for the operation of routing
   protocols.  The known boundaries will differ from router to router,
   depending on what positions the router holds in the routing
   hierarchy)"
   
"_def_(Interface Identifiers)"

"_def_(Interface identifiers in IPv6 unicast addresses are used to identify
   interfaces on a link.  They are required to be unique on that link.
   They may also be unique over a broader scope.  In many cases an
   interface's identifier will be the same as that interface's link-
   layer address.  The same interface identifier may be used on multiple
   interfaces on a single node.

   Note that the use of the same interface identifier on multiple
   interfaces of a single node does not affect the interface
   identifier's global uniqueness or each IPv6 addresses global
   uniqueness created using that interface identifier.

   In a number of the format prefixes (see section 2.4) Interface IDs
   are required to be 64 bits long and to be constructed in IEEE EUI-64
   format [EUI64].  EUI-64 based Interface identifiers may have global
   scope when a global token is available (e.g., IEEE 48bit MAC) or may
   have local scope where a global token is not available (e.g., serial
   links, tunnel end-points, etc.).  It is required that the "u" bit
   (universal/local bit in IEEE EUI-64 terminology) be inverted when
   forming the interface identifier from the EUI-64.  The "u" bit is set
   to one (1) to indicate global scope, and it is set to zero (0) to
   indicate local scope.  The first three octets in binary of an EUI-64
   identifier are as follows:

       0       0 0       1 1       2
      |0       7 8       5 6       3|
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+
      |cccc|ccug|cccc|cccc|cccc|cccc|
      +----+----+----+----+----+----+
  written in Internet standard bit-order , where "u" is the
     universal/local bit, "g" is the individual/group bit, and "c" are the
     bits of the company_id.  Appendix A: "Creating EUI-64 based Interface
     Identifiers" provides examples on the creation of different EUI-64
     based interface identifiers.
  
     The motivation for inverting the "u" bit when forming the interface
     identifier is to make it easy for system administrators to hand
     configure local scope identifiers when hardware tokens are not
     available.  This is expected to be case for serial links, tunnel end-
     points, etc.  The alternative would have been for these to be of the
     form 0200:0:0:1, 0200:0:0:2, etc., instead of the much simpler ::1,
     ::2, etc.
  
     The use of the universal/local bit in the IEEE EUI-64 identifier is
     to allow development of future technology that can take advantage of
     interface identifiers with global scope.
  
     The details of forming interface identifiers are defined in the
     appropriate "IPv6 over <link>" specification such as "IPv6 over
     Ethernet" [ETHER], "IPv6 over FDDI" [FDDI], etc.

   The loopback address must not be used as the source address in IPv6

   The global aggregatable global unicast address is defined in [AGGR].
   This address format is designed to support both the current provider

"def_(Local-Use IPv6 Unicast Addresses)"

"def_(There are two types of local-use unicast addresses defined.  These
   are Link-Local and Site-Local.  The Link-Local is for use on a single
   link and the Site-Local is for use in a single site.  Link-Local
   addresses have the following format:

   |   10     |
   |  bits    |        54 bits          |          64 bits           |

   +----------+-------------------------+----------------------------+

   Link-Local addresses are designed to be used for addressing on a
   single link for purposes such as auto-address configuration, neighbor
   discovery, or when no routers are present
   Routers must not forward any packets with link-local source or
      destination addresses to other links.
   
      Site-Local addresses have the following format:
   
      |   10     |

"_def_(Anycast Addresses)"

"_def_(An IPv6 anycast address is an address that is assigned to more than
   one interface (typically belonging to different nodes), with the
   property that a packet sent to an anycast address is routed to the
   "nearest" interface having that address, according to the routing
   protocols' measure of distance.

   Anycast addresses are allocated from the unicast address space, using
   any of the defined unicast address formats.  Thus, anycast addresses
   are syntactically indistinguishable from unicast addresses.  When a
   unicast address is assigned to more than one interface, thus turning
   it into an anycast address, the nodes to which the address is
   assigned must be explicitly configured to know that it is an anycast
   address.

   For any assigned anycast address, there is a longest address prefix P
   that identifies the topological region in which all interfaces
   belonging to that anycast address reside.  Within the region
   identified by P, each member of the anycast set must be advertised as
   a separate entry in the routing system (commonly referred to as a
   "host route"); outside the region identified by P, the anycast
   address may be aggregated into the routing advertisement for prefix
   P.

   Note that in, the worst case, the prefix P of an anycast set may be
   the null prefix, i.e., the members of the set may have no topological
   locality.  In that case, the anycast address must be advertised as a
   separate routing entry throughout the entire internet, which presents.
    a severe scaling limit on how many such "global" anycast sets may be
      supported.  Therefore, it is expected that support for global anycast
      sets may be unavailable or very restricted.
   
      One expected use of anycast addresses is to identify the set of
      routers belonging to an organization providing internet service.
      Such addresses could be used as intermediate addresses in an IPv6
      Routing header, to cause a packet to be delivered via a particular
      aggregation or sequence of aggregations.  Some other possible uses
      are to identify the set of routers attached to a particular subnet,
      or the set of routers providing entry into a particular routing
      domain.
   
      There is little experience with widespread, arbitrary use of internet
      anycast addresses, and some known complications and hazards when
      using them in their full generality [ANYCST].  Until more experience
      has been gained and solutions agreed upon for those problems, the
      following restrictions are imposed on IPv6 anycast addresses:
   
         o An anycast address must not be used as the source address of an
           IPv6 packet.
   
         o An anycast address must not be assigned to an IPv6 host, that
           is, it may be assigned to an IPv6 router only.)"

"_def_(Required Anycast Address)"

"_def_ The Subnet-Router anycast address is predefined.  Its format is as
   follows:

   |                         n bits                 |   128-n bits   |
   +------------------------------------------------+----------------+

   +------------------------------------------------+----------------+

   The "subnet prefix" in an anycast address is the prefix which
   identifies a specific link.  This anycast address is syntactically
   the same as a unicast address for an interface on the link with the
   interface identifier set to zero.

   Packets sent to the Subnet-Router anycast address will be delivered
   to one router on the subnet.  All routers are required to support the
   Subnet-Router anycast addresses for the subnets which they have
   interfaces.
     The subnet-router anycast address is intended to be used for
      applications where a node needs to communicate with one of a set of
      routers on a remote subnet.  For example when a mobile host needs to
      communicate with one of the mobile agents on its "home" subnet.)"

"_def_(
   An IPv6 multicast address is an identifier for a group of nodes.  A
   node may belong to any number of multicast groups.  Multicast
   addresses have the following format:

   |   8    |  4 |  4 |                  112 bits                   |

   +--------+----+----+---------------------------------------------+

      11111111 at the start of the address identifies the address as
      being a multicast address.

                                    +-+-+-+-+
      flgs is a set of 4 flags:     |0|0|0|T|
                                    +-+-+-+-+

         The high-order 3 flags are reserved, and must be initialized to
         0.

         T = 0 indicates a permanently-assigned ("well-known") multicast
         address, assigned by the global internet numbering authority.

         T = 1 indicates a non-permanently-assigned ("transient")
         multicast address.

      scop is a 4-bit multicast scope value used to limit the scope of
      the multicast group.  The values are:

         0  reserved
         1  node-local scope
         2  link-local scope

         E  global scope
         F  reserved

      group ID identifies the multicast group, either permanent or
      transient, within the given scope.

   The "meaning" of a permanently-assigned multicast address is
   independent of the scope value.  For example, if the "NTP servers
   group" is assigned a permanent multicast address with a group ID of
   101 (hex), then:

      FF01:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 means all NTP servers on the same node as the
      sender.

      FF02:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 means all NTP servers on the same link as the
      sender.

      FF05:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 means all NTP servers at the same site as the
      sender.

      FF0E:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 means all NTP servers in the internet.

   Non-permanently-assigned multicast addresses are meaningful only
   within a given scope.  For example, a group identified by the non-
   permanent, site-local multicast address FF15:0:0:0:0:0:0:101 at one
   site bears no relationship to a group using the same address at a
   different site, nor to a non-permanent group using the same group ID
   with different scope, nor to a permanent group with the same group
   ID.

   Multicast addresses must not be used as source addresses in IPv6
   packets or appear in any routing header.)"

APPENDIX A : Creating EUI-64 based Interface Identifiers
--------------------------------------------------------

   Depending on the characteristics of a specific link or node there are
   a number of approaches for creating EUI-64 based interface
   identifiers.  This appendix describes some of these approaches.

Links or Nodes with EUI-64 Identifiers

   The only change needed to transform an EUI-64 identifier to an
   interface identifier is to invert the "u" (universal/local) bit.  For
   example, a globally unique EUI-64 identifier of the form:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |cccccc0gcccccccc|ccccccccmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   where "c" are the bits of the assigned company_id, "0" is the value
   of the universal/local bit to indicate global scope, "g" is
   individual/group bit, and "m" are the bits of the manufacturer-
   selected extension identifier.  The IPv6 interface identifier would
   be of the form:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
   |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   |cccccc1gcccccccc|ccccccccmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm|
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

   The only change is inverting the value of the universal/local bit.

Links or Nodes with IEEE 802 48 bit MAC's

   [EUI64] defines a method to create a EUI-64 identifier from an IEEE
   48bit MAC identifier.  This is to insert two octets, with hexadecimal
   values of 0xFF and 0xFE, in the middle of the 48 bit MAC (between the
   company_id and vendor supplied id).  For example the 48 bit MAC with

   where "c" are the bits of the assigned company_id, "0" is the value
   of the universal/local bit to indicate global scope, "g" is
   individual/group bit, and "m" are the bits of the manufacturer-
   selected extension identifier.  The interface identifier would be of
   the form:

   |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|

   When IEEE 802 48bit MAC addresses are available (on an interface or a
   node), an implementation should use them to create interface
   identifiers due to their availability and uniqueness properties.
Links with Non-Global Identifiers
   
      There are a number of types of links that, while multi-access, do not
      have globally unique link identifiers.  Examples include LocalTalk
      and Arcnet.  The method to create an EUI-64 formatted identifier is
      to take the link identifier (e.g., the LocalTalk 8 bit node
      identifier) and zero fill it to the left.  For example a LocalTalk 8
      bit node identifier of hexadecimal value 0x4F results in the
      following interface identifier:
   
      |0              1|1              3|3              4|4              6|
      |0              5|6              1|2              7|8              3|
      +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
      |0000000000000000|0000000000000000|0000000000000000|0000000001001111|
      +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
   
      Note that this results in the universal/local bit set to "0" to
      indicate local scope.
   
   Links without Identifiers
   
      There are a number of links that do not have any type of built-in
      identifier.  The most common of these are serial links and configured
      tunnels.  Interface identifiers must be chosen that are unique for
      the link.
   
      When no built-in identifier is available on a link the preferred
      approach is to use a global interface identifier from another
      interface or one which is assigned to the node itself.  To use this
      approach no other interface connecting the same node to the same link
      may use the same identifier.

      If there is no global interface identifier available for use on the
      link the implementation needs to create a local scope interface
      identifier.  The only requirement is that it be unique on the link.
      There are many possible approaches to select a link-unique interface
      identifier.  They include:
   
         Manual Configuration
         Generated Random Number
         Node Serial Number (or other node-specific token)
   
      The link-unique interface identifier should be generated in a manner
      that it does not change after a reboot of a node or if interfaces are
      added or deleted from the node.
   
      The selection of the appropriate algorithm is link and implementation
      dependent.  The details on forming interface identifiers are defined
      in the appropriate "IPv6 over <link>" specification.  It is strongly
      recommended that a collision detection algorithm be implemented as
      part of any automatic algorithm.

   APPENDIX B: ABNF Description of Text Representations
   ----------------------------------------------------
   
      This appendix defines the text representation of IPv6 addresses and
      prefixes in Augmented BNF [ABNF] for reference purposes.
   
         IPv6address = hexpart [ ":" IPv4address ]
         IPv4address = 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT "." 1*3DIGIT
   
         IPv6prefix  = hexpart "/" 1*2DIGIT
   
         hexpart = hexseq | hexseq "::" [ hexseq ] | "::" [ hexseq ]
         hexseq  = hex4 *( ":" hex4)
         hex4    = 1*4HEXDIG

   APPENDIX C: CHANGES FROM RFC-1884
   ---------------------------------
   
      The following changes were made from RFC-1884 "IP Version 6
      Addressing Architecture":
   
         - Added an appendix providing a ABNF description of text
           representations.
         - Clarification that link unique identifiers not change after
           reboot or other interface reconfigurations.
         - Clarification of Address Model based on comments.
         - Changed aggregation format terminology to be consistent with
           aggregation draft.
         - Added text to allow interface identifier to be used on more than
           one interface on same node.
         - Added rules for defining new multicast addresses.
         - Added appendix describing procedures for creating EUI-64 based
           interface ID's.
         - Added notation for defining IPv6 prefixes.
         - Changed solicited node multicast definition to use a longer
           prefix.
         - Added site scope all routers multicast address.
         - Defined Aggregatable Global Unicast Addresses to use "001" Format
           Prefix.
         - Changed "010" (Provider-Based Unicast) and "100" (Reserved for
           Geographic) Format Prefixes to Unassigned.
         - Added section on Interface ID definition for unicast addresses.
           Requires use of EUI-64 in range of format prefixes and rules for
           setting global/local scope bit in EUI-64.
         - Updated NSAP text to reflect working in RFC1888.
         - Removed protocol specific IPv6 multicast addresses (e.g., DHCP)
           and referenced the IANA definitions.
         - Removed section "Unicast Address Example".  Had become OBE.
         - Added new and updated references.
         - Minor text clarifications and improvements)"
