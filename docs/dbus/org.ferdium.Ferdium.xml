    org.ferdium.Ferdium:
    @short_description: Control Ferdium from the desktop

    Interface for accessing Ferdium notification state, allowing notification
    counts to be displayed in the desktop (e.g., on a status bar) and updating
    the muted state of notifications.

    The #org.ferdium.UnreadDirectMessageCount,
    #org.ferdium.UnreadIndirectMessageCount, and #org.ferdium.UnreadServices
    are affected by notification muting and hiding settings of Ferdium.
    In particular, they are not updated if #org.ferdium.Muted is #TRUE.
    Moreover, services with muted notifications or hidden indirect message
    counts will not appear in the respective counts.
    This behavior is consistent with the behavior of the Ferdium tray icon.

    <!--
      ToggleMute:

      Toggles the muted state of notifcations.

      Use the #org.ferdium.Ferdium.Muted property to get or set the current
      muted state.
    -->
    <method name="ToggleMute" />
    <!--
      ToggleWindow:

      Brings the Ferdium window into the foreground if it is not currently
      focused. Hides the Ferdium window if is is currently focused.

      Calling this method is equivalent to clicking on the Ferdium tray icon.
    -->
    <method name="ToggleWindow" />
    <!--
      Muted:

      Gets or sets the current muted state of notifications.

      #TRUE if notifications are currently muted, #FALSE otherwise.

    <!--
      UnreadDirectMessageCount:

      The number of unread direct messages.
    -->
    <property name="UnreadDirectMessageCount" type="u" access="read" />
    <!--
      UnreadIndirectMessageCount:

      The number of unread indirect messages.

    <property name="UnreadIndirectMessageCount" type="u" access="read" />
    <!--
      UnreadServices:

      The list of services with unread messages.

      The value of this property is an array of structs corresponding to each
      service with unread messages.
      The elements of a struct are the following:

      1. The name of the service.

      2. The number of unread direct messages of the service.

      3. The number of unread indirect messages of the service.

      Services with no unread direct or indirect messages (i.e., structs with
      the second and third element set to 0) are omitted from the array.
