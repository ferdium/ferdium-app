## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Ferdium Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.
Please report unacceptable behavior to [hello@ferdium.org](mailto:hello@ferdium.org).

## What should I know before I get started?

For the moment, Ferdium's development is only starting, aiming at releasing a 6.0.0 version with the rebranded assets and tooling upgrade completed. You can join our official [Discord chat](https://discord.com/invite/xpNTzgKmHM) to get more updates and discuss issues with the other contributors.

## How can I contribute?

As a basic rule, before filing issues, feature requests or anything else : take a look at the existing issues and check if this has not already been reported by another user.
If so, engage in the already existing discussion.

## Setting up your development machine

### Install system-level dependencies

_Note:_ This list can likely get outdated. If so, please refer to the specific version of the [electronuserland builder](https://hub.docker.com/r/electronuserland/builder) that we use in our [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile).

#### Node.js, pnpm

Please make sure you are conforming to the `engines` requirements used by the developers/contributors as specified in the [`package.json`](./package.json#engines) and [`recipes/package.json`](./recipes/package.json#engine) files.

Currently, these are the combinations of system dependencies that work for MacOS/Linux/Windows. Versions are pinned down to the patch number so ensure you have the exact matching versions installed and in use.

```bash
# Note: 'jq' is not a required system dependency; its only here to show the combined output of versions needed
$ jq --null-input '[inputs.engines] | add' < ./package.json < ./recipes/package.json
{
  "node": "20.18.0",
  "pnpm": "9.12.2"
}
```

_Note:_ You can choose any version manager to manage multiple versions of `node` and `pnpm`. For eg, [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf).

#### Git

The version [2.23.0](https://git-scm.com/download) for Git is working fine for development. You can then use the console from Git to do the development procedure.

#### On Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y rpm ruby gem && gem install fpm --no-ri --no-rdoc --no-document
```

#### On Fedora

```bash
dnf install libX11-devel libXext-devel libXScrnSaver-devel libxkbfile-devel rpm
```

#### On Windows

Please make sure you have the following installed:

- Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools (2017, 2019 or 2022 - with Windows 10 SDK selected).

### Clone repository with submodule

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ferdium/ferdium-app.git
cd ferdium-app
git submodule update --init --recursive --remote --rebase --force
```

It is important you execute the last command to get the required submodule (`ferdium-recipes`).

### Run the script

Run the following script to install all dependencies, and build Ferdium.

```bash
# On Unix
./scripts/build-unix.sh

# On Windows Powershell
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1
```

Assets will be available in the `out` folder.

If you encounter the `gyp: No Xcode or CLT version` error on macOS at this step, please have a look [here](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/gyp-no-xcode-or-clt-version-detected-macos-catalina-anansewaa-38b536389e8d).

### Using Docker to build a linux-targetted packaged app (not supported as a 1st-class citizen)

```bash
docker build -t ferdium-package-`uname -m` .
```

The above will place all the built artifacts into the `/ferdium` folder within the image.

If you want to copy them outside of the image, simply mount a volume into a different location, and copy all files from `/ferdium` into the mounted folder (`/ferdium-out` in the example command below).

```bash
DATE=`date +"%Y-%b-%d-%H-%M"`
mkdir -p ~/Downloads/$DATE
docker run -e GIT_SHA=`git rev-parse --short HEAD` -v ~/Downloads/$DATE:/ferdium-out -it ferdium-package-`uname -m` sh
# inside the container:
mv /ferdium/Ferdium-*.AppImage /ferdium-out/Ferdium-$GIT_SHA.AppImage
mv /ferdium/ferdium-*.tar.gz /ferdium-out/Ferdium-$GIT_SHA.tar.gz
mv /ferdium/ferdium-*.x86_64.rpm /ferdium-out/Ferdium-x86_64-$GIT_SHA.rpm
mv /ferdium/ferdium_*_amd64.deb /ferdium-out/Ferdium-amd64-$GIT_SHA.deb
mv /ferdium/ferdium-*.freebsd /ferdium-out/Ferdium-$GIT_SHA.freebsd
mv /ferdium/ferdium /ferdium-out/Ferdium-$GIT_SHA
mv /ferdium/latest-linux.yml /ferdium-out/latest-linux-$GIT_SHA.yml
```

### Start development app

Run this command on the terminal:

```bash
pnpm debug
```

Note: please prefer [`debug()`](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) over `console.log()`.
However, due to an [Electron bug](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/31689), using `require('debug')` directly is dangerous and can lead to data loss in services.
Please use the `src/preload-safe-debug` module instead until the bug gets fixed.

### Styleguide

#### Git Commit Messages format

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit description

#### Javascript Coding style-checker

- Please use `prettier` and the defined rules to maintain a consistent style

### Code Signing on a mac (not necessary in the normal circumstances)

If you want to self-sign on a mac with non-registered certificate (not for distribution of the resulting package), you can follow [this thread](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/7476#issuecomment-356084754) and run this command:

```bash
codesign --deep --force --verbose --sign - node_modules/electron/dist/Electron.app
```

## Release

```bash
git checkout nightly && git pull -r
git checkout release
git merge --no-ff nightly --no-verify
# <manually resolve conflicts>
# <manually bump version with 'beta' name (if beta) in `package.json`>
# <run the build script for your OS from the `scripts` folder>
# <add all pertinent changes to git>
# <create commit>
git push upstream release
# Note: Do NOT allow the GHA release process to create the tag automatically, since that will be at the SHA in the develop branch and not on the release branch - which is logically incorrect
git tag v$(node -p 'require("./package.json").version')
git push upstream --tags
# Note: GHA will automatically build with publish since its the release branch
# Note: Once the GHA action is completed, verify the builds (there should be 32 assets before publishing)
gco develop
# <If its a public release, manually bump to next nightly.0 version in package.json>
# <If its a public release, manually fix homebrew-ferdium PR>
```

This will automatically trigger the build, as part of which, a new, draft release will be created [here](https://github.com/ferdium/ferdium-app/releases/). Once all the assets are uploaded (19 assets in total), publish the release (you will need elevated permissions in GitHub for doing this). The last commit of the `release` branch will be tagged.

### Nightly releases

Nightly releases are automatically triggered every day ([details](https://github.com/ferdium/ferdium-app/pull/990)) and available in [ferdium/ferdium](https://github.com/ferdium/ferdium-app/releases). Maintainers still need to verify and manually publish the draft releases as pre-releases for now.

### Updating the code after a hiatus

Since we are making a lot of changes that involve restructuring the code as well as taking a hard look at the dependencies (including node versions), please remember to update them by running the appropriate command of your chosen package manager.
